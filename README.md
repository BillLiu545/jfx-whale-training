# jfx-whale-training
In this repository is a JavaFX project simulating ethical killer whale keeping at a marine park. There is functionality to add/remove whales, as well as breeding and training them.

# How does it work?
Upon booting up, there are buttons for the user to add and remove whales. User can add whales based on input of user name and gender. Removing whales is based only on input of name. In the file menu is to train a whale based on a name input and breeding the whales based on the input of a male and female whale. Upon a user training a whale, there is an increased chance of the whale attacking its trainer.

# Remark
This is one of a few repositories in my library that uses vibe coding. I analyzed code responses generated by Copilot and made sure they functioned. Else I did some minor fixing.
